i want to know why the color of azoviolet is purple when coupled with Mg2+ in the base enviroment.
azoviolet_3.out is the azoviolet- with Mg2+, however, SMD=water 
however, the max spectrum curve are 293.7020nm, 497.4569nm, 319.412nm.(see azoviolet_3.out and )
  accroding to the wiki(Wikipedia contributors. (2024, September 27). Azo violet. In Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia. Retrieved 03:19, March 6, 2025, from https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Azo_violet&oldid=1248038048 )
  the maxium is about 432nm
i thought it may due to the Mg2+ don't carry on 2 H2O molecules.
