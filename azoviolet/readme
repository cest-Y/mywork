i want to know why the color of azoviolet is purple when coupled with Mg2+ in the base enviroment.
i.e. the structure of the unkonw molecular
azoviolet_3.out is the azoviolet- with Mg2+, without any ligands, and the solvent is wather(SMD) 
however, the max spectrum curve are 293.7020nm, 497.4569nm, 319.412nm.(see azoviolet_3.out)
i use mutiwfn to evaulate its color, it is close to the color that i observed in the lab(see dislin_1.png)

then, i try to the structure with ligand.
first, i try ligand = 2OH-
azo-_Mg2+_(OH-)2 (see azoviolet_4_neg1_TDDFT.out)
the color is displayed in the dislin_2.png
you can see the color is not match. the color is fall between the blue area and the green area.
second, i try the ligand = 2H2O, see dislin_3.png
the color is between dislin_1.png and dislin_2.png

the further research is in processing, but unavailable for you!
